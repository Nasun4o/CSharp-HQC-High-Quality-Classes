High Quality Code

Problem 1.	Abstraction
Use the VS solution "Abstraction".
•	Refactor its code to provide good abstraction. 
•	Move the properties and methods from the class Figure to their correct place. 
•	Move the common methods to the base class's interface. 
•	Remove all duplicated code (properties / methods / other code).

Problem 2.	Encapsulation
Use the VS solution "Abstraction".
•	Establish good encapsulation in all classes.
•	Ensure that incorrect values cannot be assigned in the internal state of the classes.

Problem 3.	Cohesion and Coupling
Use the VS solution "Cohesion-and-Coupling". 
•	Refactor its code to follow the principles of good abstraction, loose coupling and strong cohesion. 
•	Split the class Utils to other classes that have strong cohesion and are loosely coupled internally.

Problem 4.	Inheritance and Polymorphism
Use the VS solution "Inheritance-and-Polymorphism" 
•	Follow the best practices in high-quality classes. 
•	Redesign the classes and refactor the code. 
•	Extract abstract base class and move all common properties in it. 
•	Encapsulate the fields and make sure required fields are not left without a value.
•	Reuse the repeating code though base methods.
